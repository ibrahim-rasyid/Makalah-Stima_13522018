## General Information

The minimax algorithm is a fundamental approach in game theory and artificial intelligence, particularly in solving chess puzzles. In this study, we investigate the complexity of two search algorithms, Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), when implemented within the minimax framework for solving the Mate-in-N chess puzzle. The Mate-in-N puzzle involves finding a sequence of moves that forces checkmate in a specified number of moves. This paper contributes to the understanding of search algorithm efficiencies in combinatorial game problems, presenting a nuanced evaluation that aids in selecting  ppropriate strategies for different computational scenarios in chess and beyond.

## Requirement

- Python chess Module
- Any chess engine downloaded

## Program Setup

1. Clone this repository
>
    git clone https://github.com/ibrahim-rasyid/Makalah-Stima_13522018.git

2. Open ids.py and bfs.py, then change the engine address according to where you have your chess engine

3. To run the program, open command prompt (for Windows) or shell (for Ubuntu), then run `run.bat`

## How to Use

1. Add your .pgn file in test folder

2. Insert your .pgn file name

3. Insert which algorithm you want to use

4. The result will shown: execution time, depth, and the sequence of moves

5. Anytime you want to cancel, insert 'quit'
